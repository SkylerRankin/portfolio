          Hello, and welcome to my page. I am a sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, majoring in Computer Science.<br><br>
          Since middle school, I have been fascinated by the 0s and 1s that make up our digital world. I began writing in AS3 for Flash games, and though HTML5 has all but ended popular usage of Adobe Flash, my self-taught journey continued to other languages, libraries, and frameworks. Years later, I am now comfortable in Java, JavaScript, C#, SQL, HTML5, and CSS, along with working knowledge of Python, R, OCaml.<br><br>
          Through these, I have gained experience in front-end web development with the NodeJS/Express/MongoDB stack, android development, and design patterns such as MVC, ECS, and Observer. I have also been fortunate enough to gain multiple years of professional experience, ranging from web scraping and geo coding for voter data at the university research level to developing machine learning solutions and chatbots at GP Strategies as an intern.
          <br><br>
          Aside from coding, I like to spend my time fishing, hiking, avidly playing basketball, as well as researching and maintaining my full-scale aquaponics system. Listed below are some of the independent projects I have worked on. Feel free to reach out with any suggestions or questions about my work as well as possible work/internship opportunities and general inquiries.
